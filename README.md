# Making a flock simulator

## What I need to figure out
* Steps to start
* How to create the flocks
* How to make them move
* How to get them to flock
* Vectors

### Vectors
Vectors have a magnitude and direction. A vector is a line segment, the magnitude is length between its tail and its head and direction is from it's tail to its head. 

### First order of business
Well, I have to make some polygons appear on the screen. So I need to create a screen and I need to create some polygons. The polygons should be randomly placed but equal in size and dimensions. I have seen arrow style flocks used so will copy that shape. They are aethetically pleasing. For now, I will create a white screen and black flocks.

Pygame is not working on macs without AppKit. So I will be taking a break from the project until I learn more about classes and find another way to render the simulator.
